# COSC363RayTracingProject
This is the OpenGL Ray Tracing Project I completed for my COSC363 Computer Graphics course. For this project I implemented a few additional features.
### Additional Features
* Supersampling Anti-Aliasing
* Fog
* Non-planar texture mapping
* Refractive Objects
* Multiple Light Sources with combining shadows


### Below are some pictures of the finished project.
